    // Let's say we have an array
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    
    // now here is the problem!
    
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects

      accounts: {
        acc1: '@celocb',

      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const dev = person;
    console.log(person, dev);
    dev.name = 'Marcelo';
    console.log(person, dev);
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const dev2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
